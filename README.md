A garbage fork of YimMenu made by an idiot

This fork aims to make the game more enjoyable by adding untested broken features that crash your game.

```bash
git pull && git submodule update
premake5 vs2019
=======
Generate project files:
```bash
script.bat
```
Now, you will be able to open the solution, and simply build it in Visual Studio.

## Project Structure

- `backend/` all features that should be ran in a loop are in here sorted by category
- `gui/` includes everything related to UI elements
- `hooks/` function hooks
- `native_hooks/` hooks to natives
- `services/` service files to interact and maintain stuff
- `util/` general utility functions to keep code as compact and as much in one place as possible
- `views/` shitty ui that i'm to lazy to get rid of

## Features

Below is an incomplete list of feature that I believe are notable to this "base" or menu.

 - Return Native spoofing
 - Custom [settings](BigBaseV2/src/core/globals.hpp) with deep compare if changes were made include auto saving
 - Clear and well structured source code
 - Includes a thread pool to queue tasks that shouldn't block the game thread, very similar to fiber pool
 - Updated natives.hpp from https://nativedb.spyral.dev/natives
 - Includes basic code samples to interact with an api
 - ReClass.NET structures implemented, accessible from a global called g_local_player defined in `common.hpp`

## Contributing

You're free to contribute to YimMenu as long as the features are useful, non-toxic and do not contain anything money related that might get the menu targetted by Take2.
